# Write a program that uses filter( ), map( ) and reduce( )
# (where you may substitute normal functions for lambdas if you wish).

# Specifications

# The program works with one list of numbers entered by the user.

# filter( ) keeps only the prime numbers.

# map( ) multiplies each kept number by 2.

# reduce( ) returns the maximum of the mapped numbers.

# Input List      : [2, 70, 11, 10, 17, 23, 31, 77]
# After filter    : [2, 11, 17, 23, 31]
# After map       : [4, 22, 34, 46, 62]
# Output (reduce) : 62
